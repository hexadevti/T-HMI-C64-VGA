# C64 Emulator on an ESP32-S3 with BLE keyboard for development board Lilygo T-HMI

C64 emulator for the development board Lilygo T-HMI equipped with an ESP32-S3 chip, a 2.8 inch touch display LCD screen (ST7789V driver) and a SD card slot.
The keyboard for the emulator is simulated by an Android app, communication between the app and the emulator is realized using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).

### ESP32-S3

The ESP32-S3 is dual core containing a Protocol CPU (known as CPU 0, core 0 or PRO_CPU) and an Application CPU (known as CPU 1, core 1 or APP_CPU).
The two cores are identical in practice and share the same memory.
The tasks responsible for handling wireless networking (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) are pinned to CPU 0 by default
(see [Espressif - Task Priorities](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.0/esp32s3/api-guides/performance/speed.html)).

Core 0 is used to copy the graphic bitmap to LCD.
Emulation of the CPU and the custom chips (VIC and CIAs) are done on core 1.

### Display

The 2.8 inch ST7789V TFT LCD has a resolution of 240x320 pixel and an 8 bit parallel interface.

The display can be rotated to support the resolution of a C64 (320x200).

### Joystick

I connected an "Iduino joystick shield" to the T-HMI development board.
The joystick is optional (as there exists also a virtual joystick on the Android device) but recommended.
It has an analog 2-axis thumb joystick and several buttons.
As there are several games which use the space bar as a second fire button (e.g. Commando), another button of the Iduino joystick
can be used to simulate the pressing of the space bar.

<img src="doc/joystick.png" alt="joystick" width="400"/>

Connections:

- connect T-HMI IO16 to iduino Y pin (yellow cable)
- connect T-HMI IO15 to iduino X pin (white cable)
- connect T-HMI VDD to iduino V pin (red cable)
- connect T-HMI GND to iduino G pin (black cable)
- connect T-HMI IO18 to iduino D pin (for D button, yellow cable)
- optional: connect T-HMI IO17 to iduino B pin to simulate pressing the space bar (for B button, white cable)

Switch voltage to 3.3V on the iduino module.

If you do not use an iduino joystick or choose to use other pins on the development board,
you may have to adapt the following constants in src/Config.h:

- ADC_JOYSTICK_X
- ADC_JOYSTICK_Y
- JOYSTICK_FIRE_PIN
- JOYSTICK_FIRE2_PIN

## Installation

### Files

- T-HMI-C64.ino : Arduino .ino file of the C64 emulator, use in the Arduino IDE to upload the emulator to the T-HMI
- src/* : C64 emulator source code
- THMIC64KB/thmic64kb.apk : Android APK file to be uploaded to your Android smartphone
- THMIC64KB/app/src/ : source code of Android app
- Makefile : used to install development environment and to compile + upload code

### Installation C64 Emulator

You have two possibilities to install the emulator on the Lilygo T-HMI development board: Using the Makefile with arduino-cli or using the Arduino IDE.
Using the Makefile with arduino-cli is an automated process and is therefore usually preferable.

#### Using Makefile with arduino-cli

- Download arduino-cli for your platform (download section from https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.35/installation/),
  unpack the binary and place it in a directory included in the search path of executables (e.g. /usr/local/bin on a linux system).
- You may have to install GNU make if not already installed.
- Install required Arduino core and libraries using the following command in the directory T-HMI-C64:  
  make install
- You may have to install python3 and python3-serial if not already installed. On my linux system I had to install python3-serial:  
  sudo apt install python3-serial
- You may have to adapt the file Makefile and change the name of the serial port (adapt variable PORT).
- On a linux system you may have to add group dialout to your serial port to be able to upload code as a normal user:  
  sudo usermod -a -G dialout your-username  
  (You have to logout and login again to get the group get active.)
- Compile code:  
  make
- Upload code:  
  make upload

#### Using Arduino IDE

From [Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-HMI](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-HMI):
In Arduino Preferences, on the Settings tab, enter the [Espressif Arduino ESP32 Package](https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json)
URL in the Additional boards manager URLs input box.
Click OK and the software will install.
Search for ESP32 in Tools â†’ Board Manager and install ESP32-Arduino SDK (V 2.0.5 or above and below V3.0).

I used the following settings in the Tools menu of the Arduino IDE 2.3.2:

| Setting                              | Value                             |

| Core Debug Level                     | Info                              |

The following Arduino libraries are used (all are part of ESP32 Arduino core, version 2.0.0):

- FS
- SD_MMC
- ESP32 BLE Arduino

To upload the emulator from the Arduino IDE just open the file T-HMI-C64.ino
and choose menu Sketch - Upload or press ctrl-u.

### Install Android App

I wrote a simple Android app which provides a C64 keyboard for the emulator.

<img src="doc/THMIC64KB.png" alt="THMIC64KB" width="600"/>

You may follow these steps to install the app on your Android device:

1. Download the app directly on your Android device: Click [here](https://github.com/retroelec/T-HMI-C64/blob/main/THMIC64KB/thmic64kb.apk) to download the APK file of the app.
2. Allow installation from unknown sources:
   - Go to "Settings" on your Android device.
   - Navigate to "Security" or "Privacy".
   - Enable "Unknown sources" or "Install unknown apps". This allows you to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store.
3. Install the App:
   - Once the APK file is downloaded, open the file manager on your device.
   - Navigate to the folder where the APK file is saved.
   - Tap on the APK file to start the installation process.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Alternatively you can also install the app e.g. using Airdroid or using the Android IDE.

## Usage

### Android keyboard

The emulator starts a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) server to receive keystrokes from the Android client.

Once the app is installed and launched, you must accept the requested permissions
(access to the precise location (*not* coarse location), permission to search for BLE devices).
If you start the emulator (i.e. power on the T-HMI) before starting the app, the app will automatically connect to the BLE server.
Otherwise you can move the "BLE connection" switch to the right to connect to the BLE server. You also have to do this manually
after reseting the development board.

Besides the normal C64 keys this virtual keyboard also provides red extra buttons to send "external commands".
Actually the LOAD, DIV and several JOYSTICK buttons are available:

- LOAD: load a C64 program from SD card
- DIV: opens an extra screen with additional settings / extra functionality
- JOYSTICK 1: connected joystick can be used as a joystick in port 1
- JOYSTICK 2: connected joystick can be used as a joystick in port 2
- KBJOYSTICK 1: "virtual joystick" can be used as a joystick in port 1
- KBJOYSTICK 2: "virtual joystick" can be used as a joystick in port 2

<img src="doc/THMIC64KB_VirtJoystick.png" alt="Virtual Joystick" width="600"/>

The virtual joystick has some drawbacks in terms of responsiveness.
To play games, a hardware joystick is recommended.

Up to now the following keys are not implemented: Commodore key, CTRL key, RESTORE key

### Load and start a game

You first have to copy C64 games in prg format (only supported format!) to an SD card
(game names must be in lower case letters, max. 16 characters, no spaces in file names allowed).
You have to insert the SD card before you power on the T-HMI development board.

As there is no C64 tape/disk drive emulation available up to now, the file must be loaded
into memory using an "external command".
To do this, you first type in the name of the game so it shows up on the C64 text screen.
You then press the LOAD button on your Android phone (cursor must be on the same line and behind the game title).
If the file is found the text "LOADED" appears on screen, otherwise the text "FILE NOT FOUND" appears.
Afterwards, as usual, you can start the game by typing "RUN" followed by pressing the button RETURN.

## Software

### Class diagram

<img src="doc/classdiagram.png" alt="class diagram" width="600"/>

### Keyboard

Keyboard inputs are sent to the ESP32 via BLE. Three bytes must be sent for each key press:

- Value for the $DC00 register
- Value for the $DC01 register
- Control code:
  - Bit 0 is set when a shift key is pressed
  - Bit 7 is set when an "external command" is sent

### Emulation status

First of all: This is a hobby project :)

All hardware ports not explicitly mentioned including their corresponding registers are not emulated (e.g. user port and serial port).

"Software stuff" not emulated resp. poorly emulated resp. things to do resp. known bugs (list probably not conclusive):

- no SID emulation (and no plans to do this)
- no tape/disk drive emulation
- some VIC registers are not implemented (yet): $d01b
- some VIC registers are only partly implemented (yet): $d011 (bit 3+4)
- some CIA registers are not implemented (yet): $d[c|d]02, $d[c|d]03, $d[c|d]08, $d[c|d]09, $d[c|d]0a, $d[c|d]0b,
- some CIA registers are only partly implemented (yet): $dc0d (bit 2), $dc0e (bit 7), $dc0f (bit 7)
- not all "illegal" opcodes of the 6502 CPU are implemented yet
- Android app: implement Commodore key, CTRL key, RESTORE key
- some games have graphic errors
- some games are not working at all

### Games

As there is no disk drive emulation, only "single-load games" can be played.
Up to now I only tested a few games.

Games that are playable:

- Wizard of wor
- Skramble (from anirog)
- Galaxy
- Burnin rubber
- Lode runner
- Donkey kong

- Ghost and gobblins (graphic errors at top and bottom)
- Great gianas sister
- Hyper sports
- Blue max
- Commando (graphic errors at bottom)
- Fort apocalypse
